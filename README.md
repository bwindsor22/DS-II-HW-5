Write the following methods using RegEx

1. static bool properName(String s) - matches a proper name like Bob, Smith, Joey
2. static bool integer(String s) - a number (integer or decimal, positive or negative) 12, 43.23, -34.5, +98.7, 0, 0.0230 (but not 023)
3. static bool ancestor(String s)  - an ancestor like father, mother, great-great-grandmother. Uncles, Aunts, and Cousins are not ancestors.
4. static bool palindrome(String s)  - a 10 letter case insensitive palindrome like "asdfggfdsa". 

Of course, unit tests required...How else do you know it works. Unit tests should also include false positive testing.
